# Time in seconds to wait before resending an outgoing QoS=1 or
# QoS=2 message.
#retry_interval 20

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
# Set to 0 to disable the publishing of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# Time in seconds between cleaning the internal message store of
# unreferenced messages. Lower values will result in lower memory
# usage but more processor time, higher values will have the
# opposite effect.
# Setting a value of 0 means the unreferenced messages will be
# disposed of as quickly as possible.
#store_clean_interval 10

# Write process id to a file. Default is a blank string which means
# a pid file shouldn't be written.
# This should be set to /var/run/mosquitto.pid if mosquitto is
# being run automatically on boot with an init script and
# start-stop-daemon or similar.
#pid_file

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary
# group.
# Leave blank to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
# Note that on Windows this has no effect and so mosquitto should
# be started by the user you wish it to run as.
user mosquitto

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1
# and 2 messages.
#max_inflight_messages 20

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 100. Set
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
# See also queue_qos0_messages.
#max_queued_messages 100

# Set to true to queue messages with QoS 0 when a persistent client is
# disconnected. These messages are included in the limit imposed by
# max_queued_messages.
# Defaults to false.
# This is a non-standard option for the MQTT v3.1 spec but is allowed in
# v3.1.1.
#queue_qos0_messages false

# This option sets the maximum publish payload size that the broker will allow.
# Received messages that exceed this size will not be accepted by the broker.
# The default value is 0, which means that all valid MQTT messages are
# accepted. MQTT imposes a maximum payload size of 268435455 bytes.
#message_size_limit 0

# This option controls whether a client is allowed to connect with a zero
# length client id or not. This option only affects clients using MQTT v3.1.1
# and later. If set to false, clients connecting with a zero length client id
# are disconnected. If set to true, clients will be allocated a client id by
# the broker. This means it is only useful for clients with clean session set
# to true.
#allow_zero_length_clientid true

# If allow_zero_length_clientid is true, this option allows you to set a prefix
# to automatically generated client ids to aid visibility in logs.
#auto_id_prefix

# This option allows persistent clients (those with clean session set to false)
# to be removed if they do not reconnect within a certain time frame.
#
# This is a non-standard option in MQTT V3.1 but allowed in MQTT v3.1.1.
#
# Badly designed clients may set clean session to false whilst using a randomly
# generated client id. This leads to persistent clients that will never
# reconnect. This option allows these clients to be removed.
#
# The expiration period should be an integer followed by one of h d w m y for
# hour, day, week, month and year respectively. For example
#
# persistent_client_expiration 2m
# persistent_client_expiration 14d
# persistent_client_expiration 1y
#
# The default if not set is to never expire persistent clients.
#persistent_client_expiration

# If a client is subscribed to multiple subscriptions that overlap, e.g. foo/#
# and foo/+/baz , then MQTT expects that when the broker receives a message on
# a topic that matches both subscriptions, such as foo/bar/baz, then the client
# should only receive the message once.
# Mosquitto keeps track of which clients a message has been sent to in order to
# meet this requirement. The allow_duplicate_messages option allows this
# behaviour to be disabled, which may be useful if you have a large number of
# clients subscribed to the same set of topics and are very concerned about
# minimising memory usage.
# It can be safely set to true if you know in advance that your clients will
# never have overlapping subscriptions, otherwise your clients must be able to
# correctly deal with duplicate messages even when then have QoS=2.
#allow_duplicate_messages false

# The MQTT specification requires that the QoS of a message delivered to a
# subscriber is never upgraded to match the QoS of the subscription. Enabling
# this option changes this behaviour. If upgrade_outgoing_qos is set true,
# messages sent to a subscriber will always match the QoS of its subscription.
# This is a non-standard option explicitly disallowed by the spec.
#upgrade_outgoing_qos false

# Security
# =================================================================

# If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their
# clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default,
# all clients may connect.
# For example, setting "secure-" here would mean a client "secure-
# client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn't.
#clientid_prefixes

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to
# false then a password file should be created (see the
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access.
# Defaults to true.
allow_anonymous true     # Needs to be true for several Arduino based devices to work :(

# In addition to the clientid_prefixes, allow_anonymous and TLS
# authentication options, username based authentication is also
# possible. The default support is described in "Default
# authentication and topic access control" below. The auth_plugin
# allows another authentication method to be used.
# Specify the path to the loadable plugin and see the
# "Authentication and topic access plugin options" section below.
#auth_plugin

# If auth_plugin_deny_special_chars is true, the default, then before an ACL
# check is made, the username/client id of the client needing the check is
# searched for the presence of either a '+' or '#' character. If either of
# these characters is found in either the username or client id, then the ACL
# check is denied before it is sent to the plugin.o
#
# This check prevents the case where a malicious user could circumvent an ACL
# check by using one of these characters as their username or client id. This
# is the same issue as was reported with mosquitto itself as CVE-2017-7650.
#
# If you are entirely sure that the plugin you are using is not vulnerable to
# this attack (i.e. if you never use usernames or client ids in topics) then
# you can disable this extra check and have all ACL checks delivered to your
# plugin by setting auth_plugin_deny_special_chars to false.
#auth_plugin_deny_special_chars true

# Default authentication and topic access control

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
# offers very little in the way of security.
#
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options.
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile


# Control access to topics on the broker using an access control list
# file. If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will
# have access.
# If the first character of a line of the ACL file is a # it is treated as a
# comment.
# Topic access is added with lines of the format:
#
# topic [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
#
# The access type is controlled using "read", "write" or "readwrite". This
# parameter is optional (unless <topic> contains a space character) - if not
# given then the access is read/write.  <topic> can contain the + or #
# wildcards as in subscriptions.
#
# The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
# allow_anonymous is true. User specific topic ACLs are added after a
# user line as follows:
#
# user <username>
#
# The username referred to here is the same as in password_file. It is
# not the clientid.
#
#
# If is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the
# topic. The patterns available for substition are:
#
# %c to match the client id of the client
# %u to match the username of the client
#
# The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy.
#
# The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the
# keyword.
# Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously
# been given.
#
# If using bridges with usernames and ACLs, connection messages can be allowed
# with the following pattern:
# pattern write $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
#
# pattern [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
#
# Example:
#
# pattern write sensor/%u/data
#

# External config files
# =================================================================

# External configuration files may be included by using the
# include_dir option. This defines a directory that will be searched
# for config files. All files that end in '.conf' will be loaded as
# a configuration file. It is best to have this as the last option
# in the main file. This option will only be processed from the main
# configuration file. The directory specified must not contain the
# main configuration file.
